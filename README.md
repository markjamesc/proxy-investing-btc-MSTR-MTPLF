# Bitcoin Proxy Strategy with R and ChatGPT

This project explores a proxy investment strategy using equities that serve as leveraged vehicles for Bitcoin exposure. Specifically, we focus on:

- **MSTR (MicroStrategy)** ‚Äì The flagship corporate Bitcoin proxy
- **MTPLF (Metaplanet Inc.)** ‚Äì A high-beta Japanese equivalent dubbed the "MicroStrategy of Japan"

Rather than holding Bitcoin directly, the strategy uses technical signals, correlation analysis, and AI-augmented narrative tracking to identify when to enter or exit proxy stocks.

## üîß Tools Used

- **R**: for RSI, EMA, price correlation, and backtesting
- **ChatGPT**: for narrative monitoring, sentiment synthesis, and thesis generation
