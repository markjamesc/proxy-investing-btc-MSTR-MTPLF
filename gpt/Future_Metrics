## 📈 Momentum & Oscillator Indicators

### 1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- **What**: Measures the relationship between two moving averages.
- **Use**: Entry/exit based on MACD crossing the signal line.
- **Strength**: Works well for identifying trend reversals.

## 📊 Trend Strength Indicators

### 3. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**
- **What**: Measures trend strength regardless of direction.
- **Use**: ADX > 25 = strong trend; ADX < 20 = weak trend.
- **Strength**: Helps filter signals in choppy markets.

### 4. **Bollinger Bands**
- **What**: Bands around a moving average based on volatility.
- **Use**: Price touching or crossing bands can indicate potential reversals.
- **Strength**: Good for range-bound market detection.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Features (Advanced)

### 5. **Lagged Returns / Rolling Stats**
- **What**: Lagged % returns, rolling volatility, mean reversion signals.
- **Use**: Feed into ML models or develop custom strategies.
- **Strength**: Supports pattern discovery and predictive modeling.

### 6. **Sentiment Data (if available)**
- **What**: Crypto Twitter, Reddit, Google Trends.
- **Use**: Monitor hype cycles and retail mood.
- **Strength**: Anticipates short-term market surges or panics.

## 🔁 Volume & Market Dynamics

### 7. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- **What**: Measures cumulative volume that confirms price trends.
- **Use**: Confirms breakouts or reveals divergences.
- **Strength**: Adds volume insight to price analysis.

### 8. **Volume Moving Averages**
- **What**: Moving averages of trading volume.
- **Use**: Spot unusual activity, e.g. spikes on ENTRY signals.

## 🪙 Crypto-Specific Metrics

### 9. **Funding Rates (for derivatives)**
- **What**: Rate paid between long and short positions.
- **Use**: Extremely negative/positive funding can signal turning points.

## 🚀 Suggested Strategy Evolution

1. **Combine Metrics**: Use multi-factor signals (e.g., RSI + MACD + OBV).
2. **Backtest Each Metric**: Use the structure you built already to test each factor.
3. **Portfolio View**: Incorporate MTPLF and MSTR responses to BTC indicators.
4. **Weighting Signals**: Consider ensemble voting or scoring systems.
