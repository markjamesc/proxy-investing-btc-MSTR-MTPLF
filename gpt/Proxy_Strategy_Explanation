# Proxy Strategy Explanation

## Objective

This project explores a beginner-friendly trading strategy using a **proxy investment approach** where instead of trading Bitcoin (BTC) directly, we observe and trade **publicly listed companies** with high exposure to BTC price movements.

The two companies used:
- **MSTR** (MicroStrategy, traded in USD) — known for holding large amounts of Bitcoin.
- **MTPLF** (Metaplanet, traded in JPY) — a Japanese firm that announced Bitcoin adoption and is seen as a "Bitcoin proxy" in Asia.

## Strategy

1. **Bitcoin as the Leading Indicator**:
   - We calculate the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** of Bitcoin using a 14-day window.
   - RSI thresholds:
     - RSI < 40 → **ENTRY** signal
     - RSI > 70 → **EXIT** signal
   - These thresholds are used to simulate buy/sell decisions.

2. **Proxy Trading**:
   - Instead of trading Bitcoin, we simulate trades on MSTR and MTPLF stocks on the same dates.
   - The assumption is that these companies' stock prices are positively correlated with BTC.

3. **Backtesting**:
   - The script `03_backtest_signals.R` pairs ENTRY and EXIT signals.
   - It computes:
     - Entry/exit dates
     - Holding period (days)
     - Return percentage
   - Results are saved as `BTC_RSI_Backtest.xlsx`.

## Why This Approach?

- **Regulatory Simplicity**: Easier for beginners or those without access to crypto exchanges.
- **Stock Market Familiarity**: Useful if you are more comfortable trading equities than crypto.
- **Leverage Public Sentiment**: Stock prices of proxy firms often move with public sentiment around Bitcoin.

## Limitations

- **Indirect Exposure**: You're not holding BTC, so returns may differ due to company-specific risks.
- **Currency Risk**: MTPLF is in JPY, which introduces FX risk for USD-based investors.
- **Signal Lag**: RSI is a lagging indicator; signals may be delayed compared to real-time sentiment shifts.

## Summary

This is a simple but insightful project showing how you can:
- Use ChatGPT to guide you through a trading idea.
- Collect, clean, and analyze financial data in R.
- Backtest a strategy on stocks as proxies for crypto movement.

It's a great starting point for those new to quantitative investing and open-source finance.
